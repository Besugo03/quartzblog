Hey ! I am Alessandro Pizzuco, an IT student passionate about a little bit of everything in my field, especially hardware/embedded projects. I've started documenting what i do a bit late, so if you want to have a glimpse of the older stuff i've done, check out my [website](https://www.alessandropizzuco.com/).
